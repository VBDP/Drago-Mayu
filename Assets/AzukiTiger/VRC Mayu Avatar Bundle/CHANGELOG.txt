## Fixes
- Updated to support latest version of Jerry's Face Tracking package.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

# Version 1.42.0

## Summary
Fixes revolve around Face Tracking, some of these changes were patched silently into version 1.41, but now announcing all fixes together (you might not be able to reproduce the issue because it was already fixed). 

## Features
- Replaced Lock Gestures toggle with a Menu to select a gesture to lock each hand with.

## Changes
- Reduced Face Tracking FX controller by 2 more layers.

## Fixes
- Fixed mouth animations for interactions not working when Face Tracking is active.
- Fixed eyes not animating when Face Tracking Prefab is installed on the avatar (but Face Tracking is not active in-game).

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

# Version 1.41.0

## Features
- Eye poke is now smoothed when animating outwards!
- Foot poke is now smoothed when animating outwards!
- Reworked cheese interaction into its own layer to support multiple sound clips (not syncronized because of the speed in which cheese slap can happen).
- Reworked ear twitch to work with face tracking.
- Face tracking now uses improved smoothing and full float values for local users.
- Added new meow sound.

## Improvements
- Reduced FX controller CPU frametime by 40% by reworking the FX Controller (replaced VRCFury smoothing with own smoothing).
- Revamped Face Tracking Additions Controller to be more simple and reliable.
- Replaced Face Tracking FX controller with my own (optimized and compact).
- Replaced Face Tracking Additive controller with my own (optimized and compact).

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

# Version 1.40.0

## Improvements
- Improved custom normals! For the blender file I re-made the meshes to calculate the custom normals & reduced the `Data Transfer` modifiers from 6 to only 3, takes about 2 minutes to apply the modifiers! The ears are separated into their own mesh to apply its own `Data Transfer` modifier before merging to `Body` mesh (takes less than 5 seconds). This is because the duration to apply the modifiers depends on not only the amount of `Data Transfer` modifiers but the amount of blendshapes.

## Changes
- Legacy prefabs no longer included. You can use the `MayuBake` blender file in Gumroad to convert legacy textures to the newer UVs, a video is included. The same process can be used to bake other textures if needed (for example emission or audio link maps/masks). You'll need to recreate your avatar if you are still using the legacy prefabs, you should just be able to drag and drop your assets from the legacy prefab avatar to the latest one.
- Re-organized blendshapes of `Body` mesh with customization blendshapes at the bottom of the list.
- Minor weight paint cleanup on neck.
- `PantsOld.fbx` has been removed.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

# Version 1.38.0

## Improvements
- Removed baked AO maps from `albedo` texture (delete AO layer in substance painter files), instead only using AO maps directly for both Quest & PC materials. This removes artifacts caused by gradients when texture isn't `high quality`.
- Updated belly shadow for body, included texture to add it to existing substance painter files (short video included).
- Update quest head & body materials to use `Occlusion` slot (same texture as `Metallic` slot). This creates better shading by using the AO maps.

## Changes

- Updated all materials for fallback shaders to be Toon/Opaque/OneSided. Eyes material is set to `Hidden`.

## Fixes
- Fixed HR prefab VRCFury Full Controller component missing its global parameter.
- Cleaned up Reflections & Specular of all materials to avoid using Packed Maps expanded. All generated masks are deleted, make sure to update the masks of your own materials for Reflections & Specular if missing for: Hoodie, Collar, Pants, Eyes.

- Added toggle to change warmers appearance into latex (you can have both fabric & latex within a single material).
- Added MMD toggle, for MMD worlds that don't active it (to disable expressions).
- Added contact receivers to each eye for poke interaction.
- Now using `VRCFury Blendshape Optimizer`.
- Now using `VRCFury Unlimited Params`! This means more sliders in the menu for customizing without impacting parameter usage. Updated the following toggles to sliders: Sabertooth, Long Cheek Fluff, Female (requires 50% or higher for physbone) & Gaze Influence.

- Updated materials to Pioyomi version 9.0 with overhauled shader settings (you will need to duplicate the material again for the new settings), older Pioyomi versions incompatible. Pioyomi version 9.0 can upgrade older materials for you.
- Improved `EyeLookUp`, `EyeLookDown`, `NoseSneer` & `MouthRaiserLower` face tracking blendshapes.
- Face tracking purring no longer requires smiling (action will stop if sad, angry or shock is expression is activated).
- Custom normals for the back of the head (smoother shadows on the back hairs).
- Updated face custom normals vertex group for smoother muzzle shadows.
- Updated Normal Map textures to use `RG Compressed BC5` format (higher quality, same VRAM usage).
- Better matcap for beans and body.
- Increased eye emission intensity.
- Updated `Mayu` substance painter file with mesh double.

## Changes
- Updated to VRCFury version 1.745.0+ new component architecture, older VRCFury versions incompatible.
- Deleted face tracking animations which are duplicates of existing ones.
- Unwrapped the inner UVs for the front torso island with `Female Chest` blendshape off, this caused textures with details on the chest to look blurry. If your texture has something other than flat colors or gradients on the chest, use the `MayuNoDoubleSP.fbx` to update your substance painter file then re-export the textures.

## Fixes
- Updated cheese slap logic to prevent quick slapping.
- Better shoulder weight paint for Hoodie (less clipping on the hood).
- Weight paint fixes for pants (belt & loops).
- Fixed eye rotation values for face tracking for better responsiveness.
- Tongue physbone is no longer active unless tongue is fully out to prevent clipping.
- Updated shocked expression blendtree, previously caused issues with jittery smoothing (discovered during VRCFury regression).
