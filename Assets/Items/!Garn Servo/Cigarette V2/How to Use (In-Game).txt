Once toggled on, you can select what cigarette type you want (and where it goes (Full System Only); only exception is the ring holder cannot go in the mouth).

If you have gesture control enabled, the victory (peace) gesture will put it in either hand, and neither will go to your mouth. (Full System Only)

Active Smoking will slowly burn the cigarette down over the course of 5 minutes until it has burnt out. If you are using the Full System, the steps below can reveal another feature.

To be able to throw the cigarette butt once it has burnt out, you must be using cigarette only (holders will not work). (Full System Only)
- If it is in either hand, going to an open hand gesture will throw it, and going back to victory (peace) with the same hand will spawn a new cigarette. You do NOT need gesture control on for this work.
- If it is in your mouth, you can do an open hand gesture with both hands to spit it out, and victory (peace) with both hands to spawn a new cigarette in your mouth. You do NOT need gesture control on for this work.
- If you do not do the victory (peace) after throwing the cigarette butt, you can also toggle the system on and off to respawn it.
