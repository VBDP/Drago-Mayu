-----------------------------------------------

First ensure you have the latest VRChat Avatars 3.0 SDK, Poiyomi Pro (or Toon), Lyuma Emulator, and Avatars 3.0 Manager installed. All are linked on the store page.
If you do not have Poiyomi Pro, there is a Toon material provided in Assets/GarnCigarette/Mat+Tex. Plus if you are using a Booth-style model, there is a material preset to better suit the style.

Go to Assets/GarnCigarette/Prefabs and choose the prefab that fits your needs.
• '1-Handed Full System' is V1 of the system. It only supports 1 hand, and is Write Defaults On. But is a slightly smaller file size (less menu icons) and an easier installation.
• 'Full System' is V2 of the system. It supports both hands as well mouth placement, cigarette following mouth movement when speaking, a throwable cigarette butt, and is Write Defaults Off. But has a slightly larger file size impact (due to menu icons) and is a bit more of a difficult installation.
If you have space in your parameter memory and have a bit more Unity knowledge, I highly suggest you use 'Full System'.

Instructions for installation of each system are in the respective prefab folders.
